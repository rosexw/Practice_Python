# Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

# name = raw_input("What is your name: ")
# age = int(input("How old are you: "))
# year = str((2018 - age)+100)
# print(name + " will be 100 years old in the year " + year)


# print("Were" + "wolf")
# print("Door" + "man")
# print("4" + "chan")
# print(str(4) + "chan")

# Extras:

# Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
print(3 * "test")

# Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

print(3 * "test\n")
